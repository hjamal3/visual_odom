Done:
run the code: ./run ../../data_odometry_gray/dataset/sequences/00/ ../calibration/kitti00.yaml ../../dataset/poses/00.txt  
read soft-slam paper
get ground truth working
go through and clean main.cpp
clean up code and remove everything unnecessary
move over to vscode
bucket.h:
- defines bucket
- bucket has ID, max size, FeatureSet, and functions to add and get features
feature.h
- defines FeatureSet
- FeatureSet has vector of 2D points, vector of ages.
- deleteUnmatchFeatures, featureDetectionFast, featureDetectionGoodFeaturesToTrack, featureTracking, deleteUnmatchFeaturesCircle
circularMatching, bucketingFeatures, appendNewFeatures
frame.h/cpp
- dont use
utils.h
- drawFeaturePoint, display, integrateOdometryStereo, isRotationMatrix, rotationMatrixToEulerAngles, loadImageLeft, loadImageRight
visualOdometry.h
- matchingFeatures, trackingFrame2Frame, displayTracking
bucket.cpp
- do you ever add a feature past the age threshold? in theory it should be possible, cause adding and readding to buckets
feature.cpp
utils.cpp
- integrateOdometryStereo updates frame_pose with rotation and translation
visualOdometry.cpp
- checkValidMath: if points are within certain range of each other
- removeInvalidPoints: vector + status = vector
- matchingFeatures: adds new features, no guarantees if the features are not the same as the previous ones if less than 2000 features
- matchingFeatures: 
- about 20% of features filtered from circular matching !
- literally only doing PnP
main.cpp
read through the code files and figure out what's going on. remove anything unused

To Do:
convert to ROS
serious amount of CPU is being used btw.
try some analyzer software
